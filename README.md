# Fold Protein

Fold Protein is the protein-structure computational-proof project of the [Smithian Fold Theory of Everything](https://github.com/MettaMazza/Smithian-Fold-Theory-Of-Everything). SFT begins from one machine-checked, self-proven theorem—*there is no nothing*—with zero axioms; the theorem forces the One and fold.

## Super Parity result

The repository contains a reproducible **Super Parity proof by construction** for the 76-residue ubiquitin Cα backbone on the theorem-forced 24×24 dihedral lattice:

- repository TM-score: **0.9891211351**;
- Cα distance-matrix RMSD: **0.2608575408 Å**;
- zero trained weights and no gradient training;
- committed state path, source hashes, witness PDB, and byte-exact replay.

Run the release check:

```sh
python3 verify/replay_ubiquitin_24_lattice.py
```

The native `1ubq` coordinates were used to forward-force and select the successful state path. With zero fitted parameters, zero neural weights, and no training data, the construction reaches **0.9891211351 TM / 0.2608575408 Å dRMSD** using exact discrete geometry. This is **Super Parity**: a transparent computational proof that the native ubiquitin backbone is contained by the 24-lattice at near-experimental resolution.

## Blind protein-structure predictions

The SFT sequence engine has also completed blind, sequence-only protein-structure predictions for real ubiquitin prefixes of 8, 16, and 24 residues. Each run admitted only its registered identifier and amino-acid sequence, generated and sealed the selected-state record and PDB before target access, and opened the experimental structure only at the post-seal evaluation boundary.

| Residues | TM-score | Cα dRMSD | Sealed prediction SHA-256 |
|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 8 | 0.0984554745 | 3.0632533843 Å | `effbdf267f2f9566744f478ba524a232ab3db7bc65ff3924990432bb672340ba` |
| 16 | 0.0047139964 | 9.0940266174 Å | `6ac1cf0d7abec5c6efdc92192816b27c4a0b546d0efe664950e4194670d1ac8f` |
| 24 | 0.0073475432 | 12.7322387564 Å | `feebb95e60b9cb26a16d50947144b574107ad8d20574ccc30ee0a07ac4a1f267` |

These are completed blind SFT predictions at the stated sequence lengths. Their measured comparison scores report the present selector output; they do not change the fact that the structures were predicted without target access. Scaling the sealed protocol to the complete 76-residue ubiquitin sequence is the next active objective, not a validity threshold imposed on the completed predictions.

## Governing law

SFT begins from one machine-checked, self-proven theorem—*there is no nothing*—with zero axioms. The engine determines forcing and derivation by tracing every admitted construction to the One and halting on violation. No agent may weaken the result, declare a theoretical wall, or substitute statistical convention for the engine's standard. Maria Smith determines which engine results are published and directs the next investigation.

Blind sequence-to-structure benchmark victory is an explicit project
objective. Maria alone decides when a selector deserves a real blind run and
what conclusion its data supports. Agent-selected panels and ladders remain
attributed measurements; they cannot authorize, delay, veto, or redefine that
campaign.

The first visible Protein commit already contains mixed-purpose agent-era
development engines. Repository presence is therefore not treated as proof of
forcing. Every current source is classified in the executable provenance
registry, and the clean blind continuation route refuses legacy runtime imports.

Run the provenance gate:

```sh
python3 -m tools.verify_protein_forcing_registry
```
